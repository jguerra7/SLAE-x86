# Assignment 6

* Take up 3 shellcodes from Shell-Storm and create a polymorphic version of them to beat pattern matching
* The polymorphic version cannot be larger 150% of the existing shellcode
* Bonus point for making it shorter in length than original

## Execution

The creation of the polymorphic version of each payload chosen can be found at:

1. [shellcode-571](payload_1/README.md);
2. [shellcode-214](payload_2/README.md);
2. [shellcode-639](payload_3/README.md);

Well, this concludes assignment 6!
